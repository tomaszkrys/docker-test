Hi,

just to clarify - i did commit few minutes after the task time. It was because I was doing whole test on clean laptop, so to make it hard for me I needed to start with setup all environment components :)
So in the final phase i did run into git push problems because of lack of ssh keys which caused that i pushed my code after the task time. I hope that this small delay will not count as problematic.
